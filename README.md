# Cricket World Cup-Data-Analysis 

Created a Power BI report to identify top 11 players for a T20 Cricket Team by Scrapping data from espncricinfo with a Bright Data Website tool , cleaning and transforming the data with pandas and evaluating various player performance matrices.
Used the resulting Power Bi dashboard to select players for various categories (openers, middle order / anchors finisher , all rounders, specialist fast bowler) and ultimately choose the top 11 player to play in the match
